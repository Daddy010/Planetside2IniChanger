# Planetside2IniChanger
This tool will help you swap between 3 Useroption files.

The tool creates a new folder in your C:\ Directory with the name "PS2SwapperSettings" (C:\PS2SwapperSettings). There you have a folder called "inis" where you have to create 3 ini files with the names "air.ini", "tank.ini" and "infantry.ini" (lowercase letters). Then you can use my tool. The tool will copy the ini out of the inis folder and it will replace the current UserOptions.ini.

When starting the game you are prompted to add the Path to your Planetside 2 Directory. Example: C:\Users\Public\Daybreak Game Company\Installed Games\PlanetSide 2
This prompt will only open the first start. If you need to change the Path afterwards, change the path in the path.txt file at C:\PS2SwapperSettings.

!!! Please create a backup of your current prefered UserOptions.ini since it will be overwritten by my tool!!!
